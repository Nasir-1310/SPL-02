## About
DroidBot is a lightweight test input generator for Android.
It can send random or scripted input events to an Android app, achieve higher test coverage more quickly, and generate a UI transition graph (UTG) after testing.

A sample UTG is shown [here](http://honeynet.github.io/droidbot/report_com.yelp.android/).

DroidBot has the following advantages as compared with other input generators:

1. It does not require system modification or app instrumentation;
2. Events are based on a GUI model (instead of random);
3. It is programmable (can customize input for certain UI);
4. It can produce UI structures and method traces for analysis.
